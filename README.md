# HackerPlaybookInstall
An installation script to help with the setup of a Kali VM for The Hacker Playbook: Practical Guide To Penetration Testing by Peter Kim

This script assumes you already have a copy of Kali installed into a virtual machine. This script should be executed within the virtual machine. It will pause between each step of the process and it is recommended that you follow along with the steps outlined in the book in the event something goes wrong. Note that this script does *not* handle prompts within a few of the setup and install scripts that are called. Consult the Hacker's Playerbook for which options that should be selected.
